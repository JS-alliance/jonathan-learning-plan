# Hack your Mind


## Memory and spaced repetition

Your brain is a data structure.
Do you know how it works?
How does it delegate responsibility of sub processes?

How is the data stored?
How is it accessed?

Imagine a data structure that you have never seen or used before with

What if the data structure was constantly processing input even if you didn't give it any?

What if it worked like a sieve than a bucket, letting 90% of input get destroyed?

Just like all data structures and algorithms, your brain is a collection of trade offs. While it dismisses MOST data, it is tuned to detect the IMPORTANT data.

Unfortunately, you don't get to write an algorithm for how this detection works, BUT when you know the algorithm, you can certainly input your data in a way which leads to the outcome you desire.

If you would like to save the string 'Hello', and the algorithm for storing strings did the following:

1. Check if this data matches 'negative consequence'
1. Check if this data matches 'positive consequence'

Your body blocks out familiar patterns while anchoring the pattern to a part of your memory...

Listening to music while learning, then playing it again will help you remember.

Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman:
Our brains are more effective at problem solving when we can use memory and pattern recognition.

Recruit the specialists of your mind and use their strengths.

Anchor new knowledge to old.

Seek Understanding'

If the idea is hard to hold in your head at once, break it down and focus on a smaller concept.

## Testing effect
Test your knowledge and improve your retention
[The Testing Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect)
You should USUALLY be successful
Testing should occur after some delay
Desirable difficulty - It should be a little difficult to remember.
You'll need to practice this to start getting famliar with how this feels to you.
