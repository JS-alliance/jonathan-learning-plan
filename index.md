Overview
--------
Overview: [Take responsibility for your own learning](https://www.bloc.io/users/jonathan-lewis/checkpoints/2265?roadmap_section_id=173)

We teach the skills you need to kickstart your career as a developer and a lifelong learner.
You'll learn to solve problems with code while applying industry best practices in a collaborative environment.

A software engineer understands how and why something works, not just how to use it. They can architect solutions, understand trade-offs, and can account for scale and change. Software engineers understand computer science...
We apply it to solve complex problems efficiently.

Testing
------------
* HTML & CSS - Dev Tools
* End to End Testing
 * Introducing webdriverio and selenium to allow you to test your app at the highest level so that you can fire yourself from being the person who clicks on things and squints at each one of your pages to make sure it looks right. Let your computer do that! Bonus round is to do automated visual regression-testing. We will add e2e tests to our React app.
* Unit Testing
 * [Javascript Testing - Hack Reactor - Feed Reader Testing - Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud549)
* Unit Testing with Mocha / Chai
 * You've got your top-level tests, and that's great, but when you're working on a new function, you need to be able to test that function in isolation and get rid of the DOM. We'll learn how to write tests for your code in isolation and to make sure that your tests are readable and non-brittle. Let's add unit-tests to our React app.

Backend / Node JS
--------
[Complete NodeJS Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=922484)
[Learn and understand Node JS](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/learn/v4)


* Asynchronicity and Promises
 * Interfacing with a backend is an asynchronous operation. We will discuss JavaScript's unique conventions about asynchronicity. Asynchronous operations in JavaScript can be done in a lot of different ways, but the current hotness is to use Promises. We will talk about why these are better than callbacks and how they can be composed. We will also talk about how they can be counter-intuitive.
 * Callbacks
 * Closures
 * Algorithms
 * [Promises - Google - Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud898)
 * [Asynchronos Javascript requests - Google - Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud109)
 * File IO

- Fetch, REST
 * We'll get into the latest http-request library, called fetch. We'll use it to interface with a Github API and we'll see how we use promises within React to update the UI when calls to the backend are resolved. Now we're finally going to interface our application with the actual online live github API!

* Firebase
 * Now that we know how to interface with a well-formed and well-documented REST API, it would be nice if we could interface with one of our own. However, in today's cloud-service world, you usually don't need to build a backend to make an application. We'll talk about Firebase and we'll add a "note-taking" feature to our application which allows us to take notes on developers that we're stalking on Github.

* (BONUS Round) State management with immutable patterns
 * We learned all about functional programming and asynchronous actions, but how does that translate into a React-based world? Introducing Redux. Manage all your state transitions through pure functions! Keep your entire state system in one immutable object! Funnel asynchronous actions through thunk functions! So much fun and crazy terminology!


* Cookies
 * [A post on what cookie data is and how to store it](http://www.newthinktank.com/2010/04/javascript-scripting-tutorial-pt-4/)
