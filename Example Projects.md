* Process
 * Setting the Stage
 * Setting the Stage
 * George gathered feedback on his project idea by reviewing user stories, wireframes and his data model before developing his project.
 * By working with instructors to scope out the basic functionality of their application, he was able to make sure he was tackling something that added value to his portfolio.
* Back*end Development
 * The core of the application was built using Ruby on Rails. George chose to incorporate a Facebook login to allows users to quickly sign up and participate in the site.
* Front*end Development
 * George incorporated JavaScript into his project, adding in additional frameworks in order to provide specific dynamic functionality. He also chose to also add responsive CSS to make the application usable on mobile and tablet devices.
