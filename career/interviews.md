[Code examples to show in interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnZh0CqOCA0)
Clean code
Best Practice

Variable names: descriptive.
 * `var characterName = 'Harry Potter'`

Methods that do one thing
Methods are single purpose.

Abstract your methods to layer levels of work

do not pass strings in arguments, set the string as a variable and then pass the variable name.

Give your classes meaningful names:
 * Not 'table' but 'productTable'

 Minimize the number of log or print statements you have.  They can hide more meaningful code.
