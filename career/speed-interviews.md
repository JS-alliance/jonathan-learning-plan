How to Handle Speed Job Interviews
When you prepare for the possibility of a speed interview, you need to realize the importance of making an immediate positive impression, as is the case in another popular interview-type setting, speed dating. You must always look professional and well groomed; remembering always to adhere to the suggestions listed below in the interview.  According to Immen, as a job seeker you should always:

Familiarize yourself with what employers want to know.
Review company information including Web sites and annual reports.
Be prepared to introduce your experience, goals, and prospective benefit to the organization.
Make a positive impression through grooming and professional dress.
Bring extra copies of employment documents, such as résumés and references
Make eye contact and exercise good posture.
Act mature and professional yet positive and enthusiastic.
Pay close attention and listen carefully in order to respond appropriately in the time allotted.
Furnish complete answers but limit them to a maximum of two minutes each
Be prepared with a listing of questions to ask about the company.
Ask to schedule a follow up and demonstrate interest for the job
Follow up with a thank you card or email (that sells you for the position).

• Do Your Research
Before the speed interview event, review the list of attendees and determine your
objectives. Consider, for example, the type of position you are seeking and the employers
that interest you. Research the employers of interest and the employer representatives
expected to conduct the interviews.
• Prepare and Practice Your Sales Pitch
Based on your research of the employer and your analysis of the job description, identify
experience, skills and qualifications you possess that make you the best candidate for the
position. Develop a 60 second “sales pitch” consisting of roughly 200 to 300 words that
summarizes your unique qualifications and conveys to the employer the benefits you’ll
provide if hired. Also develop three key messages that you want to convey to the
interviewer and try to fit them into your responses during the interview.
• Mind Your Appearance
First impressions do count, especially when it comes to a speed interview. You have only
a few minutes to make a favorable impression. Dress professionally but comfortably.
Select attire and adhere to personal grooming standards suitable for work.

• Bring the Proper Tools
Be sure to bring along copies of your resume and any other requested application
materials. Consider also bringing along a writing sample and list of references. Your
business cards, a nice pen and small leather-bound portfolio with a brief list of questions
for the employers will round out your tool kit.
• Network While You Wait
Arrive at the event a bit early. Review any additional materials that are available such as
employer literature, lists of participating employers and interviewers, etc. Mingle and chat
with your peers and others in attendance. You may be able to introduce yourself to an
employer in a more relaxed setting. Additionally, employers may be observing and
assessing your social and communications skills.
• Make the Best Use of Your Face Time
Pay close attention to the interview schedule. When your name is called, walk toward
your interviewer confidently with a smile. Offer a firm handshake and greet your
interviewer. During the interview, avoid being distracted by other interviews ongoing in
close proximity. Remember to focus on the interviewer and listen carefully to his/her
questions. Be aware of the interviewer’s body language and cue to end the interview. Due
to the nature of the event, your interview may end somewhat abruptly. At the conclusion of
the interviewer, be sure to thank the interviewer and ask for his/her business card. If you
were unable to ask questions, ask the interviewer if you may contact him/her at a later
date.
• Post-Interview Tasks
If time permits, after each interview jot down notes of what was discussed and your initial
thoughts about how the interview went. Include notes that may help you remember
particular interviewers, e.g. his red tie or the fact that you both play tennis in your spare
time. Stick around after the interviews have concluded. You may have another chance
to speak with the interviewers. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, help the interviewer
remember you by sending a thank you letter or e-mail message.
