# Big 0

## Constant time
no matter how large the dataset, the return value can be inferred or determined without iterating through the data.

## Linear time
 * The complexity increases at the same scale as the dataset.
 * Looping through a set of data once
 * outputting every item in a tree once

## Exponential

 * When a constant loop contains a constant loop which scales with the same data


## Logrithmic
If the possible outcomes splits in 2 for each iteration.
 * Searching through A binary search tree

## inverse Exponential
Where n = the square root of the size of the dataset.
 * Looping through data where the end case is reached in exponentially fewer iterations the larger the data gets.


## Big O AB
When a loop of data length A contains a loop of data length B
