# Advantages and DIsadvantages


## Advantages

1. Async I/O.  This gives a speed advantage of async I/O.

2. Open source (free) developed runtime, with active community support (and Long Term Support) as a derivative advantage. While we are talking about platforms, it is worth mentioning all major platforms: Linux (on a number of architectures), Windows, Mac, AIX, SunOS.

3. Isomorphic development (front-end backend).

4. Four hundred thousand reusable modules making the planet's largest software repository makes the development productivity expponentially less would be another one

5. Inhernetly cloud-ready, and all major cloud PaaS has Node.js as the primary runtime means your Cloud production will surely receive quality support and attention.

# Disadvantages

1. Not well suited for CPU-bound tasks. But then, it is worthwhile to explain what is CPU-bound tasks in the modern workloads. We have seen that code almost everytime relents CPU for I/O. So I am yet to see a pure CPU-bound workload in commercial domain, very few exists in scientific computation with big data.
