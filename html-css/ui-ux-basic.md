### What's to learn?
As of July 2017...
 * Most people are browsing on tiny screens. (360x640)
   * only 6.6% of people are using 1920x1080 resolution, so you better have a very good reason if you are designing for this resolution.
 * less than 3.5% use anything older than IE11.
 * About 3.5% use Safari 8-10.
 * About 37% of mobile users use Safari 9 or later.
   * You should probably test your app in mobile Safari.
