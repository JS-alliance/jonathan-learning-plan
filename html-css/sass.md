Software GUI options:

<h4><a href="http://livereload.com/">LiveReload</a></h4>
<p>This magical tool does a whole array of cool things, one of which is compiling Sass. LiveReload monitors changes in the file system. As soon as you save a file, it is preprocessed as needed, and the browser is refreshed. This is a great speedy kick to your web dev workflow</p></li>
<li>
<h4><a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a></h4>
<p>This is a Mac-only app very similar to LiveReload and includes script minification, image compression and code hinting. This is the software I’ve opted for and love dearly</p></li>
<li>
<h4><a href="https://prepros.io/">Prepros</a></h4>
<p>This is a cross-platform (Linux, Mac, and Windows) GUI tool for compiling Sass and other preprocessor languages. It’s really feature rich and at the time of writing it’s available for free unlimited trial.
</p></li>
</ul>

allows you to write a shorter syntax which is compiled into css.

& selector always selects the current selectors parent.

Try to avoid nesting more than 3 levels deep to avoid overly specific selectors.








Reverse



&& selector
