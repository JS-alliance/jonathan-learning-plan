## jQuery:
animations, AJAX

Put a $ in front of an object returned from a jQuery method.

jQuery is the container which holds your selection.

The jQuery object is the state of your DOM elements at the time the function is run.

If the DOM changes, the jQuery object will not be changed.  You would need to run the function again.
